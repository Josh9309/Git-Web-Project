		<h1> Why I Chose This Topic </h1>
		
		<p>
			I chose to do my tutorial on GitHub because it is shocking how in the IGM GDD major not many students have a good grasp on what GitHub is or the basic for using it.
			It is very important in are industry to know how to properly use version control because you will come across case where your code will break and you will need to fall back to a previous version.
			Not to mention that GitHub is also a great Portfollio tool for code, because it allows employers to see your coding skill and your work ethic.

		<h1>Above And Beyond</h1>
		<p>
			For my Above and Beyond I created a whole extra page just dedicated to providing usefull resource for learning and using GitHub. I also version controlled this entire project on 
			GitHub so that people who veiw this tutorial can see an example of a GitHub project. I also created a navigation bar that stays on screen as the screen scrolls up and down.
