			<p>
				After writing a summary and title for your commit, you are now read to commit the files. There are many ways to commit to GitHub. <br/>The first way is to press the commit to master button and do it that way.
				However some times you have a lot of changes and the button is not the best way so you will need to use the git shell which you can get to by clicking the gear for the settings while you repository is open
				in the GitHub window.<br/> Once you open the shell input these 4 command lines bellow:
			</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li> git status </li>
				<li> git add . </li>
				<li> git commit -m"Commit Title here" </li>
				<li> git push origin-master </li>
			<ol>
